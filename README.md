# BondFire

BondFire is an Instagram-like social media app for Dark Souls fans. Add bonfires to real life snapshots and share with your fellow phantoms.

## Technology
- React
- Redux
- React-Native
- Possibly Firebase for the database. 
- Will need to figure out how to store images.

## Planned Features
1. Take / Select photos and add bonfires to them
2. Upload photos and share on account
3. Likes/Rating system
4. Commenting system using premade text strings, similar to messages in game
5. Geo-location detection (other users can visit other users' bonfires and add aesthetics)

### Special Thanks
- From Software
